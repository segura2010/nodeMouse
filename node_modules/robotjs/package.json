  "readme": "RobotJS\n========\n\nNode.js GUI Automation. Control the mouse, keyboard, and read the screen.\n\nThis is a work in progress so the exported functions could change at any time before the first stable release (1.0.0). [Ideas?](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/4)\n\nOnly tested on Mac OS X using Node.js v0.10.31. \n\nnode-gyp is only configured for Mac, but this project will support Windows and Linux when I have time to test.\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/robotjs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robotjs) [![Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/octalmage/robotjs.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/octalmage/robotjs) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/octalmage/robotjs](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/octalmage/robotjs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n## Installing\n\n```\nnpm install robotjs\n```\n\n## Examples\nGet the mouse location and move it. \n\n```JavaScript\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n//Get the mouse position, retuns an object with x and y. \nvar mouse=robot.getMousePos();\nconsole.log(\"Mouse is at x:\" + mouse.x + \" y:\" + mouse.y);\n\n//Move the mouse down by 100 pixels.\nrobot.moveMouse(mouse.x,mouse.y+100);\n\n//Left click!\nrobot.mouseClick();\n```\n\nType \"Hello World\".\n\n```JavaScript\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n//Type \"Hello World\".\nrobot.typeString(\"Hello World\");\n\n//Press enter. \nrobot.keyTap(\"enter\");\n```\nGet pixel color under the mouse. \n\n```JavaScript\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n//Get mouse position. \nvar mouse=robot.getMousePos();\n\n//Get pixel color in hex format. \nvar hex = robot.getPixelColor(mouse.x, mouse.y);\nconsole.log(\"#\" + hex + \" at x:\" + mouse.x + \" y:\" + mouse.y);\n```\n\n## Building\n\nRobotJS uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) for building. \n\nInstall node-gyp using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nThen confgure and build: \n\n```\nnode-gyp configure\nnode-gyp build\n```\n\n## Plans\n\n* Control the mouse by changing the mouse position, left/right clicking, and dragging. \n* Control the keyboard by pressing keys, holding keys down, and typing words.\n* Read pixel color from the screen and capture the screen. \n* Find image on screen, read pixels from image.\n* Possibly include window management? \n\n## Progress\n\n| Module        | Status        | Notes   |\n| ------------- |-------------: | ------- |\n| Mouse         | 80%           | Can't specify mouse button.       |\n| Keyboard      | 50%           | No toggle support.       |\n| Screen        | 5%            | Screenshot, read pixel color, image search.        |\n| Window        | 1%            | Manipulate external windows.     |\n\n## Story\n\nI'm a huge fan of [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/), and I've used it for a very long time. AutoHotkey is great for automation and it can do a bunch of things that are very diffucult in other languages. For example, it's [imagesearch](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ImageSearch.htm) and [pixel](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/PixelGetColor.htm) related functions are hard to reproduce on Mac, espscially in scripting languages. These functions are great for automating apps that can't be automated like [Netflix](http://blueshirtdesign.com/apps/autoflix/). This has never been a big deal since I've always used Windows at work, but for the past few years I've been using Mac exclusively. \n\nI like AutoHotkey, but I like Node.js more. By developing RobotJS I get an AutoHotkey replacement on Mac (finally!), and I get to use my favorite language. \n\n**TLDR:** There's nothing like AutoHotkey on Mac, so I'm making it. \n\nBased on [autopy](https://github.com/msanders/autopy). \n",
